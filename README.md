# NPM Bopiler Plate
This is a simple scaffolding for ES6 -> Common.js compiled NPM Modules. 
Used for Open or closed NPM's

## Features

1. Babel pre publishing -> `src` -> `dist`
2. Copy Script -> `src/static` -> `dist/static`

## Use it?

1. Clone, revise package, version it etc etc.  NPM install. 
2. Replace the readme and all paths!
3. Write some awesome re usable code. 
4. Build it! npm run build ( other wise it will be done in the next step but better be safe than)
5. Publish it. https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/publish

This does not include or utilize typescript, and probably never will.
